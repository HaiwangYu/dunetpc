This calibration was performed in Dec 2019 using the December 2018 external pulser dataset.
It is v2 reco in ~/dladams/proc/obsolete/201911_calib, i.e. uses the old, wider
standard ROI window: (-10, 20) after the March 2019 ROI bug fix.

The gain distributions differ slightly from those with tighter windows shown in the
2019-12-11 DRA and subsequent meetings.
