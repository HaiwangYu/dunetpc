protoDUNE_g4.fcl: Basic g4 fcl file for MC
protoDUNE_g4_12ms.fcl: Uses basic MC g4 fcl and adds a 12ms lifetime
protoDUNE_g4_12ms_sce.fcl: Uses basic MC g4 fcl and adds a 12ms lifetime and space charge disortions using the old/outdated parametric method
protoDUNE_g4_12ms_sce_datadriven.fcl: **Recommended default ** Uses basic MC g4 fcl and adds a 12ms lifetime and space charge disortions using the data driven map
protoDUNE_g4_12ms_sce_voxel.fcl: Uses basic MC g4 fcl and adds a 12ms lifetime and space charge disortions using the simulated map without fluid flow
protoDUNE_g4_12ms_sce_voxel_fluidFlow.fcl Uses basic MC g4 fcl and adds a 12ms lifetime and space charge disortions using the simulated map with fluid flow
