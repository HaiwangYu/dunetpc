# Dataprep tool configuration for protoDUNE DQM.

# User is now expected to provide a top-level fcl file
# that creates or reads in RawDigits and calls a module
# (most likely DataPrepModule) that runs the RawDigitPrepService.
#
# The tools write many large files for each event and so this
# is typically run with a small number of events.
