Module_SNClustering.C runs on the output root file generated by SNAna_module.cc.
The path to an example root file is given in the code. In this file the variable MarlTime is treated as a double, if you generate your own root file using SNAna, MarlTime is treated as a vector. Module_SNClustering.C must be changed as necessary.
Clustering configurations can be tweaked in Module_SNClustering_Config.h
Analyse_SNClustering.C runs on the output root file generated by Module_SNClustering.C and will calculate an indivudual SN neutrino efficiency and corresponding background rate. Relevant histograms are written to Analysis_*.root.
