# On Alex Himmel's request -- turn all of the photon detector Acrylic to LAr
# in the DUNE 10kt *_nowires_legacy.gdml files, in order to make photon library generation
# easier.

# some assumptions -- the photon detectors are the only acrylic in these files.
# this is the case for the 10kt geometries as of April 2017, but we'll skip doing
# this for ProtoDUNE's and 35t -- they have acrylic cosmic-ray taggers, and their
# photon detector volumes are already LAr in the *_nowires_legacy.gdml files for them.

# to do later -- de-acrylify only those Acrylic lines right after the optical
# detector names
