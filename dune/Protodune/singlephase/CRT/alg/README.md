crt-alg
Portable algorithms for working with data from the ProtoDUNE-SP Cosmic Ray Tagger.  
Algorithms should depend only on crt-core so that they can be used equally easily in 
LArSoft or with an independent loop over EBuilder output.  Base algorithms for 
online-monitoring and maybe a low-level event display should live here.
